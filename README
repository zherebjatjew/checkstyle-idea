A plug-in for JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA 14 which provides real-time
feedback against a given CheckStyle (http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/)
profile by way of an inspection.

Released under a BSD-style licence - please see the LICENCE file for details.

============================================================================


Use
---

Once installed, a new inspection will be available in the group 'CheckStyle'.
The 'Inspections' item in the preferences panel will allow you to turn this on
and to configure it.

Project exceptions are treated a little oddly. Because CheckStyle demands these
to be on the current classpath errors will appear if these have not as yet
been compiled. Further, because we cache the real-time checkers for performance
reasons, real-time scans may continue to show the errors after a compilation.
A static scan will force a reload of the Checker and should resolve this.


Configuration
-------------

Configuration is available under the Settings dialogue. This controls
configuration for both the inspection and static scanning.

- Configuration File tab -

The main configuration option is that of the CheckStyle file. Multiple
CheckStyle file may be added, and swapped between by using the checkbox.
Files may be added using the 'Add' button.

The 'Scan Test Classes' checkbox will enable scanning of Java files
under test source roots. If disabled, these files will be ignored.

If a custom file is being used and properties are available for definition
then these will accessible using the 'Edit Properties' button.

- Third Party Checks tab -

This tab allows you to specify any third-party checks which your
configuration file makes use of. All selected directories/JAR files
will be added to CheckStyle's classpath.


Troubleshooting
---------------

If an error occurs during the check an exception will be thrown, which
IDEA will then catch and display in the standard exceptions dialogue. If
you're unsure as to why things are awry this would be your best bet - chances
are it's a missing property or classpath pre-requisite.


Notable Extensions
------------------

* sevntu.checkstyle - http://sevntu-checkstyle.github.io/sevntu.checkstyle/

  sevntu.checkstyle offers a number of useful checks written by students of the
  Sevastopol National Technical University (SevNTU). They're also kind enough to
  offer instructions on setting them up with this plugin.


Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

q) I see 'Got an exception - java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to get class
   information for <Exception Class>. (0:0)'
a) CheckStyle is unable to retrieve information on exceptions in your project
   until you have built it. Build your project in IDEA and then rescan.


Limitations
-----------

* The plugin will throw exceptions if used with class files targeted at a
  later version than that of the JDK used by IDEA. In particular, this will
  affect Mac users with JDK7 project (as IDEA runs on JDK6 by default). The
  solution is to target class files at the version of the IDEA JRE
  (i.e. 1.6 for Mac users) or to switch IDEA to use JDK7. Thanks
  to J. G. Christopher.

* If you change the configuration options the real-time scan will not be updated
  until the file is either changed or reopened.

* We do not check if a property definition is required for a given file.
  Hence you can exit configuration without setting required properties. Given,
  however, that CheckStyle files can change without the plug-in being aware
  this is something we'll always have to live with to some degree.

* CheckStyle errors and warnings from the inspection are both shown at
  a single level, as IDEA will only allow one warning level for an inspection.

* Loading a file from a URL is current experimental and not guaranteed to do
  anything at all.


Future
------

The following are potential features which are likely to be investigated
for future releases.

* Scan selected files/folder in the project panel.
* Better error feedback.


Feedback
--------

Any comments or bug reports are most welcome - please visit
the project website at https://github.com/jshiell/checkstyle-idea/


Acknowledgements
----------------

This plug-in owes its existence to both the style-overlords at work mandating
compliance with a CheckStyle configuration, and the Eclipse-CS
(http://eclipse-cs.sourceforge.net/) authors for making me jealous of the
real-time scan support available for Eclipse.

Thanks to those who have contributed work and effort directly to this project:

* J. G. Christopher
* jicken
* Jonas Bergvall
* Edward Campbell
* LightGuard.JP
* Gerhard Radatz
* Benjy W
* Yuri
* Kristin Young
* Simon Billingsley
* Miel Donkers

 And also thanks are due to the authors and contributors of:

* Eclipse-CS, for inspiration and solutions to coding problems.
* JetStyle, for filling the area of static scanning and also giving me
  inspirations on coding solutions.
* CheckStyle, for without them we'd have merely void and chaos.
* JetBrains, for an IDE which is worth every penny and then some.

And a big thank-you to everyone who's sent me feedback or bug reports - both
are much appreciated!
